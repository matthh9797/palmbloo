    Koh Chang is one of the best places either of us had ever been for food with local places never dissapointing and even a very good standard of Western food if you know where to look. In a local place you could expect to pay ฿50-฿80 ($1.45-$2.33) per dish and we would generally pay under ฿200 ($5.82) for dinner which would usually include a side dish or shake.
    Most of our recomendations are local places that we found and never expensive touristy places except a couple of western restaurants for pizza, burgers etc. Note that some of the places had no name, no sign, some didn’t even have an English menu. In that case we will put the type of food in place of the name, you can refer to the pinned location on Google Maps.

    <p>
    We stayed mainly in Khlong Son and White Sand Beach, but we also stayed for a few nights in Khlong Prao and Lonely Beach and toured the island 
    quite a so we got a pretty good idea of what each place has to offer. Below are some details for our favourite areas on the island. 
    </p><p>    
    Note we have not included Kai Bae, this area didn't suit us due to lack of local food options and expensive bars. We have also missed out Bang Bao the main 
    ferry point to the other islands, we only visited here a couple of times, it seems nice enough but there wasn't seem to be a lot to do.
    </p>

tips:
  header: Some Practical Tips
  description:
  recomendations:
    - Bangkok Bank White Sand Beach, best place to convert money or exchange them.
    - A scooter is the best way to get around the island. If not you can use a shared taxi.
    - The activities and spots which charge tourist 200 baht are a rip off 
    - There is a massive hill in the middle of Koh Chang, be carefull not to drive too fast around the corners!
    - There are no free Elephants on the island only captive ones, we would advice against giving these people money
