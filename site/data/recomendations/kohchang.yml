    Koh Chang is one of the best places either of us had ever been for food with local places never disappointing and even a very good standard of Western food if you know where to look.
    Most of our recommendations are local places that we found and never expensive touristy places except a couple of western restaurants for pizza, burgers etc. Note that some of the places had no name, no sign, some didn’t even have an English menu. In that case we will put the type of food in place of the name, you can refer to the pinned location on Google Maps.

  header: Where Should You Stay?
  description: > 
    <p>
    As well as Klong Son and White Sand Beach, we also stayed for a few nights in Klong Prao and Lonely Beach and toured the island 
    quite a lot so we got a pretty good idea of what each place has to offer. Below are some details for our favourite areas on the island. 
    </p><p>    
    Note we have not included Kai Bae, this area didn't suit us due to lack of local food options and expensive bars. We have also missed out Bang Bao the main 
    ferry point to the other islands, we only visited here a couple of times, it seems nice enough but there didn't seem to be a lot to do.
    </p>   
  recomendations:
    - name: White Sand Beach

        - Shops and supermarkets
      cons:

        - Not many shops or cafes or bars

tips:
  header: Some Practical Tips
  description:
  recomendations:
    - To avoid ATM charges and get the best exchange rate go to Bangkok Bank White Sand Beach with your passport.
    - A scooter is the best way to get around the island. If not you can use a shared taxi.
    - The activities and spots which charge tourists 200 baht are often disappointing and there are better cheaper options. 
    - There is a massive hill in the middle of Koh Chang, be careful not to drive too fast around the corners!
    - There are no free Elephants on the island, only captive ones, we would advise against giving these people money.

  header: Our Favourite Experiences 
  description: > 
    Koh Chang is a big island and it has a lot to offer in terms of activities. Be aware that a lot of the sightseeing spots 
    which come up on Google charge foreigners five times the price of locals. We tried both Koh Yak and Khlong Plu
    and were disappointed by the experiences so we will not recommend any of these but in our opinion some better alternatives.

conclusion:
  header: Closing Thoughts 
  description: >
    If you want a relaxing holiday, surrounded by beautiful beaches and unspoilt jungle, consider Koh Chang island. If you are looking for a party island you would probably
    be better choosing somewhere else.  We loved it there and it was exactly what we were looking for, a chilled environment with adventurous activities, beautiful nature, 
    great food and the opportunity to soak in some authentic Asian culture.
