    Koh Chang is one of the best places either of us had ever been for food with local places never dissapointing and even a very good standard of Western food if you know where to look. In a local place you could expect to pay ฿50-฿80 ($1.45-$2.33) per dish and we would generally pay under ฿200 ($5.82) for dinner which would usually include a side dish or shake.
    Most of our recomendations are local places that we found and never expensive touristy places except a couple of western restaurants for pizza, burgers etc. Note that some of the places had no name, no sign, some didn’t even have an English menu. In that case we will put the type of food in place of the name, you can refer to the pinned location on Google Maps.

  recomendations:
    - name: White Sand Beach
      description:
      pros:
        - Range of accommodation options for all budgets. We stayed in Tantawan which was a basic room but X baht per night in peak season with aircon and right on the beach. We also found some nice cheap looking places on the North part of the beach, most aren’t on booking.com (reference our maps)
        - Great food. Although for local options you had to walk to South side, not a far walk
        - Range of bars and cafes
        - The beach is naturally very nice
        - Shops and supermerkets
      cons:
        - The main strip is westernised so if you want a truly local experience you may be better elsewhere
        - Not so easy (but always possible) to get a sunbathing spot when the tide is in unless offered by your accommodation.
        - A lot of prositution in the area
    - name: Lonely Beach
      description:
      pros:
        - Laid back vibes
        - Great sunset spot
      cons:
        - It’s not a party place, this can be a pro or a con depending on your preferences.
        - Lack of shops and cafes with WiFi in the area
        - Water wasn’t very clear
