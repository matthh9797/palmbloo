conclusion:
  header: Closing Thoughts 
  description: >
    We stayed in Siem Reap for 3 weeks which was a little too long in the end, although, we think this would be a great place to stay for 4 days to 1 week. The city is much less hectic than Phnom Penh but still hectic. The local people are really nice, 
    of course, it is hard to get to know them as often they will be trying to sell you stuff but if you get past that, you will enjoy getting to know them.
