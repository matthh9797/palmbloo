conclusion:
  header: Closing Thoughts 
  description: >
    If you want a relaxing holiday, surrounded by beautiful beaches and unspoilt jungle, consider Koh Chang island. If you are looking for a party island you would probably
    be better choosing somewhere else.  We loved it there and it was exactly what we were looking for, a chilled environment with adventurous activities, beautiful nature, 
    great food and the opportunity to soak in some authentic Asian culture.
