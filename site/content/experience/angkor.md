### A Brief History

The City of Angkor is a massive ancient city of the Khmer Empire located in North-Western Cambodia, in the Krong Siem Reap province. The entire Angkor temple complex measures around 400 km{{< sup "2" >}} and consists of hundreds of temples which were built between the 9{{< sup "th" >}} to the 15{{< sup "th" >}} century. Angkor Wat is an architectural masterpiece within the City of Angkor and the largest religious monument in the world â€“ covering an area four times the size of Vatican City.[^1]

### The Costs

{{< boostrap-alert type="warning" text="Note that the prices quoted are from the beginning of 2023 and they go out of date very quickly!" >}}

We spent one day at Angkor Wat and the ticket cost us $47 each. If you go for 3 days you can get a cheaper rate but we thought that was a bit too many temples for us. We hired a private tuk tuk driver for the day for $25 and paid around $10 for lunch (the prices for food are a bit more expensive than in Siem Reap).

### How Much To Pay The Tuk Tuk Driver?

The price for a tuk tuk driver can vary widely and we heard of people paying anything between $15 to $50. We wanted to make sure we weren't being scammed but at the same time we were paying a fair rate for a full days work. We liked our tuk tuk driver and he even sent us a video of his son saying "Thank You" afterwards so we were happy to pay a little over the cheapest rate.

### Should You Rent A Bike?

We also met people who had hired bikes to ride around the City of Angkor. As we mentioned in the introduction the City of Angkor is really big so our advice on this is get a tuk tuk driver if you are only going for one day and want to see all of the main temples. However, if you have bought a ticket for a few days renting a bike would definitely be a good option for day 2 or 3.

### Our Agenda

{{< schedule >}}

### Angkor Wat

{{< boostrap-alert type="info" text="We recommend getting a tour guide, they are only $10 for the full day and they are well trained and speak very good English and just about every other language" >}}

We started our day in Angkor Wat, the most famous temple in the City of Angkor and it did not dissapoint. We arrived at 9am, having decided to skip the sunrise - we had heard from people that had been before us that it was a little dissapointing. When we arrived at the entrance we were hassled by a bunch of guides who were trying to sell us thier services. We waved them off and decided to walk around ourselves but later regretted the decision.

Angkor Wat represents the abode of Hinduism's ancient gods, this spectacular temple is quite literally heaven on earth and the jewel in the Khmer archaeological crown. It's the largest of all Angkor's temples and one of the best preserved.

We climb up to the top of Angkor Wat, this climb is steep and a little scary, but well worth the view, as you can see 360 view and the giant garden in front, infact, after spending some time visiting the temple we decided to take a walk in this park.

### Ta Prohm (The Tomb Raider Temple)


for me the most amazing temple complex in the Siem Reap temple sites. 
Absolutely fascinating from the 600 year old trees and their fantastic root system.
This is where part of the first *Tomb Raider* was filmed.
If you have to choose only one temple, this is a must see.

### Lunch Time

After these two amazing temples we decided to take our lunch break to charge some energy, the day was very hot and walk around for hours could be quite exhausting. We stop in a local stall as we saw the cambodian people cook a delicious chicken on BBQ.


### Lake Nokor Thum

The food was so amazing, we felt very full after it so we walked towards the lake Nokor Thum to chill.

### The Temple Where We Got Lost


### Angkor Thom And The Monkeys

The day started to be more and more hot so for the afternoon part we chose something more "relaxing" to do, we wanted spend some time with the monkeys, so our tuk tuk driver brought us to Angkor Thom park where we could sit down and watching the monkeys playing together.

### The Sunset At Phnom Bakheng

The golden hour started to getting closer so we climbed a hill call Phnom Bakheng which is a small temple and  one of the best spot for sunset. We sat here and we watched the sun go down until tired from this big day we got back to our place. Once arrived we sadly say hello to our tuk tuk driver which was such an amazing kind human being which we enjoyed spent our day with.

### Closing Thoughts

If you go to Cambodia don't forget to visit this iconic temple, truly the the experience of lifetime!
