## Practicalities

Besides having the Toba Lake, North Sumatra has also other natural beautiful destinations, like Bukit Lawang. Bukit Lawang is located in Bahorok Village, depends from where you traveled, from Medan, the location has a distance of about 80 km and can be reached in about 2-3 hours drive, if you traveled like us from Berastagi the distance is about 3-4 hours. 

## What to know

The atmosphere here is so cool because the location is inside the Gunung Leuser National Park. Bukit Lawang is the natural habitat of orangutans, but unfortunately they are losing their habitat due to forest clearing for palm oil plantations. If you go to Bukit Lawang, trekking is a mandatory activity. Before to arrive here, we booked in advance 3 days trekking throw a company called " The Jungle Guide". Our aim was feel the real jungle vibes so we were super excited to do it. Our trekking has been amazing and extremely funny. We spotted 10 orangutans (including 4 alpha males) and lots of other wildlife like gibbons, Thomas leaf monkeys, monitor lizards and other animals.

### Day 1 

Our first day of trekking started around 9am where, after breakfast,we met our Jungle Guide which explained us what we were going to do that day. We met the semiwild orangutans swinging in the trees around us having lunch etc until we arrived around 4pm in one of the first campsites to swim and chill. They prepared for us a delicius dinner and we chatted with our tour guide for all night then we fell aslepp surrounded by magical jungle sounds.

### Day 2 
  
The day after we woke up around 8am. After a beautifully decorated breakfast of toast and omelet with some vegetables we pack all of our bags and we started hiking again between 9 and 10 am. We trek again in the deeper parts of the rainforest where we had more chance to see orangutans. That day we saw also a baby orangutan chilled in the tree with her mother. We reached another campsite next to the river, surrounded by memorable sounds of the rainforest and we spend another day swimming and enjoy the rest of the night. 
### Day 3 

 The third and last day of our trekking we reached a cool waterfall and then we did rafting down the river Bohorok wich has been very fun! 

### Junia Guesthouse 

After this adventure we fell completely in love with this magical place as it's very authentic and our favourite spot so far. We booked our accomodation in Junia Guesthouse which is much more than a normal guesthouse, it's for us now like a home. This place as a communal area where people can chat together, singing songs and playing guitar all night. Compare to the other guesthouse around Bukit Lawang, here you have actually the space to use the laptop and meet other travellers plus the rooms are very nice and spacious. 

### Why we stayed 2 months here 

While we were staying in Junia we found out that lots of guesthouses offer also trekking, not only the accomodation, that's why us and so many western people book with other companies, but people don't know it because a lot of these places don't have a proper website. 
One day we were speaking with the manager of Junia and we discovered they need someone that could make one, so we asked if we could help them in exchange of accomodation and food. They were agree about it so we started every day for a total of 20 hours per week to build their website which you can find here https://juniasumatratreks.com/.
