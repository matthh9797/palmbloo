### Description

Thailand is the most popular South East Asian country for tourism. It was Matthew's introduction to South East Asia and he wanted to go there to "make his own mind up" about a country that you hear mixed things about.

We visited Bangkok, Koh Chang and Koh Kood in Thailand spending only two nights in Bangkok before heading to the islands for a month and half. We found the two experiences to be polar opposites. The city hectic and the islands amazingly calm.
