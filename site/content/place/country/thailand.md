### Description

Thailand is the most popular South East Asian country for tourism. It was Matthew's introduction to South East Asia and he wanted to go there to "make his own mind up" about a country that you hear mixed things about.

We visited Bangkok, Koh Chang and Koh Kood in Thailand spending only two nights in Bangkok before heading to the islands for a month and half. We found the two experiences to be polar opposites. The city hectic and the islands amazingly calm.

### What to eat?

Let's start with the most important part when you visit Thailand.

### The people

A culture of food 

One thing we noticed in Thailand is that people work very long hours. All day and all night from a very young age.

We noticed local people drinking more alcohol than we expected and it was common to see people sharing a bottle of Whisky and tonic every night.

### Tourism

I wondered as we travelled through Thailand how it had managed to get a headstart on it's neighbours in Tourism. The main reason Thailand become the main gateway to South East Asia was due to the development of the large airport in the 60's.

### World Trade

Although tourism is massive in Thailand most of it's economy revoloves around trade, with the total value of exports and imports equivelant to 98% of it's GDP in 2020. To put that in persepctive the World average was 52% in 2020, 56% in the UK and 23% in the US. [^1] [^2]
