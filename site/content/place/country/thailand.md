Thailand is the most popular South East Asian country for tourism. It was Matthew's introduction to South East Asia and he wanted to go there to "make his own mind up" about a country that you hear mixed things about.

We visited Bangkok, Koh Chang and Koh Kood in Thailand spending only two nights in Bangkok before heading to the islands for a month and half. We found the two experiences to be polar opposites. The city hectic and the islands amazingly calm.

### What to eat?

Let's start with the most important part when you visit Thailand. We're not going to list out all of the amazing dishes we tried in Thailand but here are a few you've got to try:

- **Noodle Soup:** simple but a great lunch time option very popular with Thai locals.
- **Stewed Thai Chicken:** We discovered this late in our trip but were addicted, popular at lunch time.
- **Tom Yam Soup:** The national dish is a must try but beware it's spicy!
- **Thai Style Fish:** Cheapest place I have ever ate a big fish like this, so good.
- **Chicken Cashew Nut:** Lulu's favourite dish was one we didn't expect to find here but we loved it.

### The Thai Culture

Thailand really is the "Land of smiles". We found the people to be extremely happy and polite.

Central to that is their culture of communal eatting, the most common Thai Phrase is *Tan khao ma rue yung?* which means "have you eaten yet?". If the answer is *Yung* "not yet", Thai people will invite eachother into their homes for food or a snack. We noticed at night local people would often share a bottle of Whisky and tonic in groups of neighbours, friends and family. There was a real sense of community with the local people, they seemed to eat with eachother and help eachother and that was really refreshing to see.

In talking to locals one thing that had come up was the tough years of COVID. I remember speaking to "Tan" our trek tourist guide and him say it was hard and really boring with no one around, lots of people closed down their local businesses or even left Koh Chang aa tourist based economy to find work elsewhere. This interaction made me think about what had caused Thailand to be such a big tourist hub in the first place and how many tourists there were compared to it's neighbouring countries.

### Tourism in Thailand

The main reason Thailand developed as a major tourist hub was due to the development of XYZ airport in Bangkok in the 60's. In the past decade Thailand has become the second largest South East Asian destination of tourists, second only to the much bigger country of China. [^1]

This made me wonder how the collapse in tourism over the COVID-19 period would have effected Thailand as a whole.

### The Export Orientated Economy

In turns out that most of Thailand's economy revoloves around trade, with the total value of exports and imports equivelant to 110% of it's GDP in 2019. To put that in persepctive the World average was 56% in 2019, 63% in the UK and 26% in the US. [^2]
So what does Thailand make? Most of Thailands exports are X, then Y and Z. Office machine parts, Gold, Cars and Motor vehicles are all big industries in the Thai economy. [^3]

### Conclusions

The culture of Thailand is centered around their delicious food. The people of Thailand were amazing, smiley and happy and inspired me to dig deeper into how the country works. The Thai economy is export orientated by this does not play down the devastation on local economy caused by COVID-19.

Sometimes as backpackers we like to think of ourselves in a seperate bin to tourists. In reality backpacking is just another form of tourism. One that often includes digging a little deeper into the culture of a place. I won't comment on whether tourism on the whole is a good thing for the World but I will say that I am happy to see the magic little local tourist based economies such as that on Koh Chang island starting to do a little better.
