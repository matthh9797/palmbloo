Siem Reap is the "Gateway to Angkor Wat". Although most people use it as a stopping point for Cambodia's main attraction, the city itself has a lot going for it and it is worth sticking around for a few days.

The city is a lot smaller and less hectic than Phnom Penh with some nice spots when it comes to bars, restaurants and cafes. We stayed here for a few weeks, so we got a good idea of what the city has to offer.
