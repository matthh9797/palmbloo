For the first destination in our South East Asian adventure we chose Koh Chang island in Thailand and what a choice it turned out to be. The amazing food, pristine sandy beaches, a mountainous interior made up of [protected national parkland](https://www.thainationalparks.com/mu-ko-chang-national-park) and a range of local communities makes this a perfect place to live a chilled but adverturous lifetsyle.

Koh Chang is Thailand’s third largest island and it took us about an hour by scooter to drive from top to bottom{{< footnote "1" >}}. The island can be reached from Bangkok by bus, car or a short flight, then a ferry from Laem Ngop ([From Bangkok to Koh Chang]({{< ref "/place/routes/from-bangkok-to-koh-chang.md" >}})). The climate on Koh Chang is tropical all year round, with rainy season from May to October and dry season which is regarded the best time to visit between November and February.

### Where did we stay?

We spent most of our time in two main areas *Khlong Son* and *White Sand Beach*.

Our first destination was at a workaway to help stray dogs in Khlong Son which is the first area you pass when heading down the West Coast from the ferry point. We loved the area as it was a very local and rarely visited by tourists, the food options were great and there is a very nice beach that is not too busy.

After three weeks at the workaway we decided to stay in White Sand Beach, mainly motivated by the variety of cafe options so we could work on the blog. At first, we thought it was going to be too touritic for us but we actually loved it. We got a cheap accomodation which was a very basic bunglow but right on the beach and went for a jog along the beach every morning. There are some great cafes here and good live music.

### East Coast vs West Coast

In this case depends what do you prefer, the west side is more touristy because there are cafes, beaches, supermarkets, etc. At the beginning we didn't want to ending up in a crowd area, but our priority by that time was having a place on the beach to chill but also work on the laptops and having a good wifi connection. To be fair we didn't find the west coast too crowded compare to places like Phuket or the other islands of Thailand.  
If you fancy a break from the beach or from the tourist centres of the West side of Koh Chang then you will be well rewarded by a day or more exploring the ‘undiscovered’ East Coast of the island. This side of the island is far less developed than the other and you will be treated to a view of a more traditional Thai way of life as you watch local farmers and fisherman go about their business.
