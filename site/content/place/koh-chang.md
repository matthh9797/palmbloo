{{< boostrap-alert text="This article's main focus is to give some extra information about our favourite places. For a full set of our recommendations, check out our personal [Google Maps for Koh Chang](www.ourgooglemapwhenexists.com)" type="primary" >}}

For the first destination in our South East Asian adventure we chose Koh Chang island in Thailand and what a choice it turned out to be. The amazing food, pristine sandy beaches, a mountainous interior made up of [protected national parkland](https://www.thainationalparks.com/mu-ko-chang-national-park) and a range of local communities makes this a perfect place to live a chilled but adverturous lifetsyle.

Koh Chang is Thailand’s third largest island and it took us about an hour by scooter to drive from top to bottom[^1]. The island can be reached from Bangkok by bus, car or a short flight, then a ferry from Laem Ngop ([From Bangkok to Koh Chang]({{< ref "/place/routes/from-bangkok-to-koh-chang.md" >}})). The climate on Koh Chang is tropical all year round, with rainy season from May to October and dry season which is regarded the best time to visit between November and February.

### Where did we stay?

We spent most of our time in three main areas *Khlong Son*, *White Sand Beach* and *Khlong Prao*.

Our first destination on the island has been the workaway place situated in Klong Son, is the first area you reach when heading down the west coast from the two ferries, Centrepoint Ferry at Dan Khao and Koh Chang Ferry at Ao Sapparot. We stayed in this area for three weeks and we loved it, Klong Son is a part of the island which is not so known and then not very visited by tourists which makes it very peaceful.

### East Coast vs West Coast

In this case depends what do you prefer, the west side is more touristy because there are cafes, beaches, supermarkets, etc. At the beginning we didn't want to ending up in a crowd area, but our priority by that time was having a place on the beach to chill but also work on the laptops and having a good wifi connection. To be fair we didn't find the west coast too crowded compare to places like Phuket or the other islands of Thailand.  
If you fancy a break from the beach or from the tourist centres of the West side of Koh Chang then you will be well rewarded by a day or more exploring the ‘undiscovered’ East Coast of the island. This side of the island is far less developed than the other and you will be treated to a view of a more traditional Thai way of life as you watch local farmers and fisherman go about their business.

### Where to Eat

Koh Chang is one of the best places either of us had ever been for food with local places never dissapointing and even a very good standard of Western food if you know where to look. In a local place you could expect to pay ฿50-฿80 ($1.45-$2.33) per dish and we would generally pay under ฿200 ($5.82) for dinner which would usually include a side dish or shake.

Most of our recommendations are local places that we found and never expensive touristy places except a couple of western restaurants for pizza, burgers etc. Note that some of the places had no name, no sign, some didn't even have an English menu. In that case we will put the type of food in place of the name, you can refer to the pinned location on Google Maps.

- [Thai food]() (*White Sand Beach*) - Our favourite place, we tried several dishes here and it never dissapointed.
- [Thai food]() (*Khlong Son*) - The first time we tried this place we thought we had walked into someone's living room, a proper authentic local experience, this place was so cheap and never dissapointed
- [Bam & Boy]() (*Khlong Prao*) - If you have never tried Thai style stewed chicken, go here at lunch and try it, amazing!
- [Find this place on maps]() (*Salak kok*) - You will find this one on just about every other Koh Chang article you will read but never the less Salak Kok fish needs to be done.
- [Tao's burgers]() (*White Sand Beach*) - This is a proper burger stall, all of Tao's burgers are homemade and you can taste the quality of the beef.
- [Night Market Stalls]() (*White Sand Beach*) - Get them to make you a table with some chairs and try either the BBQ chicken or fish with some potatoes.

### Where to stay

- White Sand Beach
    - We liked:
        - Range of accommodation options for all budgets. We stayed in [Tantawan]() which was a basic room but X baht per night in peak season with aircon and right on the beach. We also found some nice cheap looking places on the North part of the beach, most aren’t on booking.com (reference our maps)
        - Great food. Although for local options you had to walk to South side, not a far walk
        - Range of bars and cafes
        - The beach is naturally very nice
        - Shops and supermerkets
    - Be aware:
        - The main strip is westernised so if you want a truly local experience you may be better elsewhere
        - Not so easy (*but always possible*) to get a sunbathing spot when the tide is in unless offered by your accommodation.
        - A lot of prositution in the area 
- Lonely Beach
    - We liked:
        - Laid back vibes
        - Great sunset spot
    - Be aware:
        - It’s not a party place, this can be a pro or a con depending on your preferences. 
        - Lack of shops and cafes with WiFi in the area
        - Water wasn’t very clear

### Some practical tips

- Bangkok Bank White Sand Beach, best place to convert money or exchange them.
- A scooter is the best way to get around the island. If not you can use a shared taxi.

### Favourite Activities

- [Trekking with Tan]() (*cost per person*, *location if one*) - 
- [Cooking class]() (*cost per person*, *location if one*) - 
- [Kayaking to an island ]() (*cost per person*, *location if one*) - 
- [SUP board on lonely beach sunset]() (*cost per person*, *Lonely Beach*) - 
- [Khlong Chao Lueam Waterfall]() (*cost per person*, *location if one*) - We were recommended this beautiful waterfall by the Cambodian lady who we worked with. The walk to the waterfall is nice, definitely a cool place to swim in a fresh cool water pool. Also we were completely alone so we could swim and enjoy the peace of the jungle

### Our favourite cafes

- [Kohchahokkaido milk tea]() (*White Sand Beach*, *Cafe to work*) - we have been in this cafe for three weeks to work with our laptops every morning, coffee is delicious and you can use wifi and plug.
- [Tr Coffee]() (*White Sand Beach*, *Cafe to work*) - Good coffee, smoothie and food. Owner is friendly. Vey good price. 
- [Marin Coffee]() (*White Sand Beach and Khlong Prao*, *Cafe to work*) - we found other two Marin Cafes around Ko Chang, the coffee is good and they have the possibility to work with your laptop 

### Our favourite beaches

- Blue Haven in Klong Son,  A resort but we discovered that beside is private property is possible access easily, the guards around allowed us lots of time, the beach is extremely clean and it’s a lovely place to relax
- White Sand Beach ( the most north part of this beach ) less crowded


### Bars

We didn’t drink in bars often in Koh Chang due to our budget and general preference to drink a beer on the beach at our place. But there were a few that were cool: 

- [Oodie's Place]() Thai/Folk/Rock live music bar. Popular island hangout. 
- [Sunset hut beside tantawan]() This is a hut on the beach. Cool place for sunset. Tapas Bar
- [Trippy place in Lonely beach]() Like many places in Lonely Beach this was chill rather than party vibes. But it was cool …

### And most importantly - where to watch football??

- The White Elephant
- Dodo
- Kebab Station - Bit of an odd suggestion but this place had an English owner who had a massive screen for football. Although every time we went in we were the only customers.
