For the first destination in our South East Asian adventure we chose Koh Chang island in Thailand and what a choice it turned out to be. The amazing food, pristine sandy beaches, a mountainous interior made up of [protected national parkland](https://www.thainationalparks.com/mu-ko-chang-national-park) and a range of local communities makes this a perfect place to live a chilled but adventurous lifestyle.

Koh Chang is Thailandâ€™s third largest island and it took us about an hour by scooter to drive from top to bottom{{< footnote "1" >}}. The island can be reached from Bangkok by bus, car or a short flight, then a ferry from Laem Ngop ([From Bangkok to Koh Chang]({{< ref "/place/routes/from-bangkok-to-koh-chang.md" >}})). The climate on Koh Chang is tropical all year round, with rainy season from May to October and dry season which is regarded as the best time to visit between November and February.

### Where did we stay?

We spent most of our time in two main areas *Klong Son* and *White Sand Beach*.

Our first destination was at a workaway to help stray dogs in Khlong Son which is the first area you pass when heading down the West Coast from the ferry point. We loved the area as it was very local and rarely visited by tourists, the food options were great and there is a very nice beach that is not too busy.

After three weeks at the workaway we decided to stay in White Sand Beach, mainly motivated by the variety of cafe options so we could work on the blog. At first, we thought it was going to be too touristy for us but we actually loved it. We stayed in a cheap and very basic bungalow that was right on the beach and went for a jog along the beach every morning. There are some great cafes here and good live music.

### East Coast vs West Coast

It's important to know when you go to Koh Chang that the island is split into two sides and there is no road connecting them at the bottom. We were told by the people that the Thai government didn't want the island to turn into a destination for "hairy bikers" to do loops around.

The West coast of the island is the touristic side whilst there few people living on the East coast, mainly farmers and fishermen. The main reason for the major tourist development on the West coast is that this is where almost all of the beaches are. However, in terms of natural beauty the East coast has lots to offer as well, including waterfalls, mangroves and islands.

We decided to stay on the West coast for all of our time on the island due to the beaches and better development, it was also nowhere near as busy as other major islands on Thailand. However, we ventured round to the East coast several times to check out the mangroves, waterfalls and fishing villages. If you fancy an adventure or to really get away from the crowds we are sure you would enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the East.
