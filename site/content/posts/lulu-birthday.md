My birthday on Koh Chang Island started with a beautiful breakfast at [Tango Bar](https://www.facebook.com/BeachTangoWhiteSandBeach/) located on *White Sand Beach*. We ordered a banana pancake and scrambled eggs with toast.

After this we reached Kai Bae Beach where we rented a kayak and went to one of the small island off of Koh Chang. The kayak we rented was from [Summer Sup Koh Chang](https://www.facebook.com/SummerSupKohchang/) and the price for the full day was ฿400 (*£9.37*). From here we paddled out to Koh Man Nai.

We thought it was going to be easy but in reality it was pretty difficult! We hadn't done much kayaking together so it took us a while to get our co-ordination but after a bit of side to side movement we started to get into our rhythm. It took us 30 minutes in total to reach the island.

It was a lot of fun because after we arrived on this little island where we finally lay down. We chilled on the beach and ate some freshly made fried rice which we picked up in the morning. 

> The island was nice but unfortunately it was full of plastic ( sadly many beaches in Thailand are populated by plastic )

After spending about an hour and half on our private island we decided to paddle back. After a full day of kayaking and a lot of sun to the head Lulu started to paddle the kayak in circles, she decided it would be best for her to take a rest and let Matthew paddle the kayak by himself. Finally, we reached the kayak rental station where we celebrated our achievement with a few coconuts on the beach and a dip in the water.

As a birthday present from Matthew we rented a bungalow called [Nature Beach](https://naturebeachresort.com/) with an ocean view. The room was simply amazing, we had our bathroom, a queen size bed and this door overlooking the pool a step away from the beach. We arrived just in time for the sunset which I highly recommended because it is wonderful, the vibe was so chill!

After enjoying a couple of cocktails and the sunset we started to get hungry so we chose a beach restaurant that had this table framed with a heart. We ate delicious food here, papaya salad, pork ribs and Stir-Fried Chicken with Cashew Nuts!

After dinner some volunteer girls from the place where we are doing our WorkAway joined us to have a drink together, we tried a bottle never heard before, *black cock*, and other shots. 
We ended up quite drunk, Matthew jumped on the pool naked **sorry I don't have a picture** and that is the end of my adventurous birthday.
