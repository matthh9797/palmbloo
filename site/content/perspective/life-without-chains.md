Recently I was brought closer to a dream I have always had, a life without chains. In Koh Chang Island in Thailand there is no McDonalds, no subway, no KFC, no Costa, no Burger King, not even a Starbucks. What an amazing experience it was.

In Koh Chang we learnt where to eat through trial and error. There was no reliance on the modern day rating system and most places had no online prescense, in fact few even had a name. So you would just have to choose based on spotting if the food looks good on your way past, do they look smiley? Does it look local? That kind of thing.

Wow the food was good, not just the food but there were numourous independant little cafes with wifi! People served you with a smile and took pride in their creation whether it was the food or the coffee. The little things were done right.

A stark contrast when we moved to the more institutionalised island of Langwaki in Malaysia. Unfortunately all of the afformentioned names had moved to town. It is because of this I believe that the place was lacking in independant little cafes. That meant our only option for a reliable internet connection was Starbucks.

Every day I would ask for a minor change to my morning cappucino to try and get them to produce something reasonably drinkable. But they seemed to have an amazing talent to get it wrong every time. Except I don't think it was a talent I just don't think they cared and why would they?

There is no personal pride for them in making Starbucks coffee. It's not their creation and it is not their risk if the business doesn't work. More than that Starbucks know they have a model which means they can serve bad coffee and it won't matter.

Take me for example, desperate not to have to sit in a starbucks yet giving them my money every day due to lack of other options.

### My dream

So I go back to my dream. A life without chains. Where customer service exists. Where quality matters, where listening to the customer matter. Back to Koh Chang island and I pray that if I visit this magical place 10 years down the line I don't find a Starbucks plunked in the middle and my favourite cafe a thing of the path.
