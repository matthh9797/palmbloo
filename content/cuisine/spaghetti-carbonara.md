    The recipe for *carbonara* began to appear in 1944. It is said that American soldiers, during the Second World War, tasted the Abruzzese " cacio e  uova " pasta prepared by *carbonari* and from here it could be born the name *carbonara*. From there, adding the bacon, came almost natural.

directions:
- Cut the Guanciale length wise. Grate the pecorino with a fine grater. Split the eggs and keep only the yoke. Use a spice grinder to crush the pepper.
- To fry the Guanciale, fry on a medium heat with no oil since there will be a lot of fat. At the same time cook the spaghetti in a large deep pan. Cook both for 13 minutes.
- To make the cream add the grated pecorino and crushed pepper to the egg yokes and mix them together. The cream should be quite a thick consistency. 
- Drain the spaghetti but do not discard the cooking water and add it to the frying pan. Take the pan off of the heat and toss the spaghetti with the Guanciale. Add the cream on top of the spaghetti and toss again. Next, add a ladel of cooking water for a creamy texture and toss once more.
- Take the ladel and a pointed kitchen utensil. Twirl the carbonara inside the ladel and add to the plate.
