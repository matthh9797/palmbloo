directions:
- Cut the Guanciale length wise. Grate the pecorino with a fine grater. Split the eggs and keep only the yoke. Use a spice grinder to crush the pepper.

- To make the cream add the grated pecorino and crushed pepper to the egg yokes and mix them together. The cream should be quite a thick consistency.
