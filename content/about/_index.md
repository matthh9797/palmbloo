title: "About us"
---

We are a couple who met in Australia whilst travelling. Lulu is Italian and she is passionate about videography, photograpy and marketing. Matt is a programmer who loves coding and building websites, like this one :smiley:

We believe true travelling is gaining authentic local experiences and using them to think introspectively about what is important in life. This means that our tips and recommendations are focussed on experiencing the culture of a place rather than only taking pictures and moving on. 

This does not mean that we don't believe in taking amazing pictures or videos - only that we travel with this as secondary thought. So we are often looking for hidden gems and trying to avoid waiting in large queues for instragramable tourist spots. We like eating local food rather than dining in expensive restaurants. We would rather stay in a basic accomodation on the beach or in the jungle than an expensive resort with a big pool and all inclusive food and drink. 

If that sounds interesting to you then we hope you will enjoy reading our blog. In general, we hope this website is useful for anyone who is interested in travelling or would like to find out more about the world!
