We are a couple who met in Australia. We believe that to get the most out of travelling you should find authentic local experiences and use them to think introspectively about what is important in life. This means that our tips and recommendations are focussed on experiencing the culture of a place rather than simply taking pictures and moving on.

If we've caught your interest then we hope you will enjoy reading our blog. We hope this website is useful for anyone who is interested in travelling or would like to find out more about the world!
