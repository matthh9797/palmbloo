One of the main attractions I have towards open-ended travelling is the freedom of mind. Having no place or job to go back to allows you to completely rethink and reprioritise what makes you happy before making a decision about the next stage of your life.

Travel has given me time to decide what I enjoy doing both techinically and in free time as well as time to think about lifestyle and how to live. These extended periods overseas have improved several aspects of my character such as my ability to self-study and apply learnings practically, my social confidence and mindfulness. I believe all of that shines through in your motivation towards your chosen career and lifestyle. 

### What brought my attention to travelling the first time?

The first time I chose to go travelling the idea was brought to me by a bit of luck. One night in Glasgow I met a guy through a friend of a friend who had followed a differnt path in life to most of the people I knew - he was an ex army soldier who was driving trucks in Glasgow and had decided to move to Australia to do his working holiday. 

After a night out I ended up at this guy's flat when he came up with an idea "you should come to Australia too". Instinctively I said yes and despite the intoxication I knew I was serious. There was something drawing me towards this unknown world of travelling much more than the thought of diving into the corporate world. And so it all began ...

### How travel has helped my personal career

Before choosing to go to Australia I had been to a few interviews for graduate jobs in Data Analytics. As a fresh mathematics graduate with little knowledge of coding I was turned down from every interview with the same reason - I hadn't enough experience.

In Australia, I spent time studying machine learning and taught myself to code to a high enough standard that I was able to get a job within a pretty short period of time when I had returned. The way I see is taking a year out to travel saved me £12,000 - £15,000 in loans for a masters degree.

But much more importantly travelling allowed me to realise that I loved coding in the first place. When you finish University there is so much pressure to choose what you want to do quickly and stop being a negative asset on your parents bank account. That pressure had me considering all sorts of careers that would have taken me down paths that would have led to me being unhappy in my chosen career.

> The freedom of mind and time to follow your intuition is my favourite thing about travelling

In Australia I learnt all sorts, I read many books and took online courses in Finance, Web Development, Data Sciencea and Blockchain. The freedom of mind and time to follow your intuition is my favourite thing about travelling. I became much more confident that something in the world of programming and data would be a good choice for me and was more ready to take on a career.

### How travel has helped me grow comfortable socailly

During my University and school years, I hadn't really interacted with that much of a diversity of people. Most of my friends were from Scotland and even although I had always been interested in different cultures I had never felt comfortable enough interacting with people from other countries to establish proper friendships.

The first year in Aus dramatically changed all of that. I met so many people in hostels from everywhere in the World and became very comfortable with making conversation with anyone, no matter where they were from. When I look back at the experience, this has to be one of the main things I got out of it.

### People widen your perspective

I love learning how people live and work. There is also a really special feeling about being in a situation and just thinking "what am I doing here?". 

### Experiences make you feel alive



### Why choose to journey across South East Asia after two years working?

I decided to journey to South East Asia because I wanted to take a slight career change and I decided to take time to decide what that would be. I find having time to learn new skills is a great way to decide what you would like to do next in life. 

It is amazing what being in a completely new environment does for your motivation and hunger to learn. In fact, Asian culture has inspired me to take this blog a lot further than I had previously intended. Whilst originally I was planning to just help Lulu build a website, I felt that I enjoyed the sharing and take the blog further. 

### What is it to travel?

One thing I have noticed whilst writting this article is that it is much easier to talk about the reasons you travelled in hindsight.

I think this sums up what it is to travel. You learn to nurture the art of serendipity - to find what you are not seeking guided by your intuition. Going to places and undertaking activities which causing seemingly beautiful accidents to happen. The chance of which is shrunk by the goal orientated, overplanning, overbooking nature of the modern day world. 

Maybe it isn't completely clear to me right now why I am here but I am confident that my instinct will guide me and when I read this back in a couple of years all the dots will link together.
